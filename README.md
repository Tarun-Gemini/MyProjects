This is a basic Power BI project regarding Netflix_shows. Report includes various visualization charts and graphs which gives insights into Netflix world.

Business problem:

A Netflix associate wants to understand the frequency of shows being released on Netflix, what are the popular genres, how are the shows rated, etc. They also want to understand these aspects based on different dates it gets released on the Netflix Platform and compares stats based on Movies or TV Shows alone.
